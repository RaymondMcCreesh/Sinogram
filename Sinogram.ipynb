#Assignment: Project 1, Image Reconstruction from Sinogram
#
#Description: This source code converts a sinogram into the captured image.
#             1)The coloured sinogram is seperated into 3 channels Red,Green,Blue.
#             2)Each colour channel is reconstructed without a filter using back
#               propogation. 
#             3)The colour channels are converted to frequency domain using fft.
#             4)Each channel is ramp filtered.
#             5)All channels are converted to the spatial domain using inverse fft.
#             6)The channels are then back projected.
#             7)They are rescaled to an 8 bit image and cropped accordingly
#             8)The colour channels are resconstructed back to 1 image.
#             10)Steps 3-8 are repeated for a hamming window filter and a Hann
#                window filter.
